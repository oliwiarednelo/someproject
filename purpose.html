        <h1>SoMe purpose</h1>
        <p>Our SoMe project is focusing on helping future and current international 
            students. Moving to Denmark and generally abroad may be difficult, therefore, 
            we are creating this project to lead the users to their goals, and potentially make them apply to BAAA.</p>
    
            <div class="someplatforms">
                <h2>Why have we chosen Instagram, Facebook and Tik Tok as our main SoMe platforms?</h2>
                <p>Platforms Facebook, IG, and TikTok were used as the main platforms for our content as they are most used platforms of our target group with. 86% of people ages 18-29 use Facebook, while 67% of people ages 18-29 use Instagram (2021). This combination also enabled us to make our content both serious
                    and fun. On Instagram we give some practical, useful information; on Facebook we are friendly and 
              support the user mentally; on Tik tok we put goofy videos to have a positive influence on the user.
